## **Summary**

I'm a software developer with a career focus on building innovative products to inspire creativity in customers.  I've contributed to over 20 new software product launches as a developer, tech lead, or architect, including software that has won an Emmy and software that applies deep learning to solve problems never solved before.

I have a collaborative, pragmatic approach to software development - I believe in using the best tool for the job.  I have a track record of enabling teams to excel technically through mentorship and collaborative system design.

## **Key Skills**

 * Development and productization of **machine learning** solutions, using **pytorch**, **Tensorflow** and **ONNX**, including edge deployment with **Tensorflow Lite** and custom code
 * Deep professional experience creating software in **C++20**, **Typescript**, and **Python**, strong personal experience with **Rust** and **Haskell**
 * Guiding teams to continuous improvement of practices and tools such as **codebase design**, **CI/CD**, **automated regression testing**
 * Signal processing algorithm design and implementation for **audio effects**
 * Designing APIs, systems, and libraries to enable teams to quickly create valuable features
 * Communicating the needs and goals of engineering teams to non-technical stakeholders
 * Developing robust and high quality **cross-platform**, **multi-threaded**, and **soft real-time** software
 * Developing software for **Apple** platforms, **Windows**, **embedded Linux**, **bare-metal embedded**, **Linux-based servers** and **containers**, and the **web**
 * Improving quality and adding new capabilities to large, pre-existing codebases
 * Measuring and improving run-time performance of code
 * Technical leadership for agile product teams
