## Selected Commercial Projects

### [iZotope Morph One](https://support.izotope.com/hc/en-us/articles/6658100128273-iZotope-Labs-and-Morph-One-FAQ) (2022)

This audio plug-in, available to subscribers of [Music Production Suite Pro](https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/music-production-suite-pro-monthly.html), allows users to transform their singing voice into one of a 6 of instruments using **deep learning**.  In this project, I had a triple role of signal processing developer, architect, and [shakuhachi player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi).

As signal processing developer, I implemented the signal processing sub-system of the plug-in.  Collaborating with a member of the Audio Research Team, I developed the first real-time audio plug-in implementation of the **[ddsp](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp)** voice-to-instrument approach invented at Google.  I invented and implemented novel optimizations to enable the algorithm to run in real time.

The product team created a cloud-connected update system capable of delivering auto-updates to the UI and DSP components separately, along with a system for rapid development of high-performance UIs.  As architect, I enabled the team through collaboration, mentorship, facilitation of technical design meetings, and by implementing important subsystems such as a novel communication layer between the UI and DSP components.

### [iZotope RX 8](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx.html) (2020)

iZotope RX 8 was a version of the RX suite, an award winning, industry standard tool for reparing audio.  I've worked on many versions of RX during my time at iZotope, beginning with RX 4.  In RX 8 I took on a dual role as architect and signal processing developer.

As a signal processing developer, I collaborated closely with the Audio Research Team to improve the subjective quality and run-time performance of the **deep learning**-based "Music Rebalance" module.

As architect, I provided mentorship and guidance on technical decisions and how to effectively use our in-house frameworks.  Additionally I implemented enabling systems for processing to be run in a new plug-in format, ARA, providing better integration with users existing workflows.

### [iZotope RX Dialogue Match](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/dialogue-match.html) (2019)

iZotope RX Dialogue Match solves a common audio problem in TV and Movie Production - dialogue recorded during filming doesn't match the audio recorded later.  RX Dialogue Match provides an automated solution to this problem using **deep learning**.

As technical lead, I interfaced with Product Management, the Audio Research Team, and other stakeholders, and participated in project planning.  I facilitated team decisions on process and technical matters.  I advocated for the use of **prototypes** and **user testing** to discover answers to critical design questions before we wrote production code.  I advocated for technical work to be done in small slices.

## Selected Open Source Projects

My open source contributions can be found on [github](https://github.com/russellmcc) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/russellmcc).  Generally I take on projects either to learn new technology, explore my interests, or to solve a practical problem for myself.

### [An audio plug-in framework using Rust and React Native](/posts/2019-06-30-Brinicle.html)

In this project, I explored a framework for creating audio plug-ins using one language (**Rust**) for the signal processing components and another language (**ECMAscript**, **React Native**) for the user interface components.  While only developed to a proof-of-concept level of polish, this project is an attempt to inspire audio developers to imagine techniques beyond the traditional approach of using C++ for all parts of an audio plug-in.

### [A web-based memorization tool written in Haskell and ReScript](https://gitlab.com/russellmcc/flashcards)

This was a project I developed for my personal use for foreign language learning.  It's a simple flashcard system using [spaced repitition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) techniques.  While I likely wouldn't recommend this particular tech stack in a professional team context, the project was an opportunity to explore and use new (or new-to-me) technology, including **GraphQL**, **GitLab CD**, and [**ReScript**](https://rescript-lang.org).  I'm particularly excited about the use of the [**Fraxl**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fraxl) library to elegantly solve the [N + 1 queries problem](https://medium.com/doctolib/understanding-and-fixing-n-1-query-30623109fe89#c2c9).

### [In-progress design for an polyphonic music synthesizer with a software layer in Rust](https://gitlab.com/russellmcc/poly-mcu)

This is by far the most ambitious and complex hardware project I've attempted, and it remains in-progress.  It is interesting in that it contains an analog implementation of a filter I originally [co-invented as a digital effect](https://dafx2020.mdw.ac.at/proceedings/papers/DAFx2020_paper_70.pdf).  The software control portion is written in embedded **Rust**.

### [A CPLD-based digital oscillator for synthesizers](/posts/2019-06-14-Alpha-DCO.html)

This project is a modern homage to a favorite synthesizer of mine from the mid-80s.  This project is unique among my open source work in that it uses configurable hardware programmed in **Haskell**.

## Technical Hobbies

### Analog circuit design for musical applications

As a hobby, I design analog music synthesizers and some other equipment for the creation of music.  I am primarily inspired by the engineering behind synthesizers from Japan during the early-to-mid 80s.  My designs are differentiated by their open source nature and their use of modern, affordable parts.  Most designs include some digital or software component.  I use **Kicad** for schematic capture and PCB layout, and whatever software task best fits the project (often **Rust** with [**RTIC**](https://rtic.rs/1/book/en/))

### Connections between Mathematics and Programming

As an undergraduate, I became fascinated by the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry–Howard_correspondence) and began a continuing journey to understand Mathematics and the connections between math, logic, physics, and the act of programming.
