That's right!  I've made [yet](/posts/2013-01-27-hexbuffer.html) [another](2013-05-14-headphone.html) [open-source](/posts/2013-12-01-DCO.html) eurorack module!  This one is a simple mixing utility module that mixes up to four inputs together into one output.  It's suitable for both CV and audio signals.

Unlike the DCO, but like my other modules, this one is a very simple circuit with easy assembly.  It was a nice break from all the complication of my last module.

The fabrication stack was the almost exactly same as the last few times, with designs done in [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/), fabrication by [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/), assembly done at home with [laser-cut](http://www.dangerawesome.co/) stencils with the help of [my friend Brendan](https://github.com/brendan0powers).  The only new step was desigining the front panels with the [rhino for mac](http://www.rhino3d.com/) beta.  Even though this was a 3D program, it worked much better for technical 2D designs than [inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/), with the exception of format support.

Panels were again laser-cut out of [acrylic](https://www.inventables.com/) with the paper mask still on, and then spray-painted.

As always, design files, BOMs, and mouser orders are available [on github](https://github.com/russellmcc/euromixer), under a permissive license.  Enjoy!
